# GMM
Gaussian Mixture Model based on Expectation Maximization and DBSCAN

A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is a parametric probability density function represented as a weighted sum of Gaussian
component densities, each with its own set of parameters : a mean vector, variance and a mixture weight. GMM computes the probabilties of a data point belonging to each cluster; the point is not assigned to any partcular cluster.

The parameters and output probabilities are computed using the Expectation Maximization(EM) algorithm.
